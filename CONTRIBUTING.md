# Contributing

* Linting: Make sure you've linted the project with [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) and fixed the resulting warnings/errors (if any) before submitting the PR.
* Style: Please make sure your commit messages follow [Teknasyon Git Commit Conventions](https://github.com/Teknasyon-Teknoloji/git-commits-style).
  
* Testing: We are humans, error happens and will happen so please make sure to unit test your changes before submitting the PR.
  
* Versioning: Consider our release cycle - We try to follow SemVer v2.0.0.
  
* Breaking changes: Breaking changes are a bad user experience for the users. Contributions should avoid introducing breaking changes unless it's strictly necessary.

* Documentation: As the project grows and we continue to add more features, keeping the documentation up to date is crucial for developers to adopt them, for example adding support for a new feature or changing a method signature must update README file accordingly.

* Changelog: The CHANGELOG.md file contains a list of changes that are released with new versions. Pull requests should add an entry to that file describing in one sentence what the change is about.

* Merging: A pull request is ready to be merged once there are at least 2 approvals from the repo maintainers.

* Consistency: It's important that the changes are consistent with the rest of the project, try to follow solid principles.
